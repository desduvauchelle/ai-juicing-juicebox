		<p>IDEA:<br />
			The idea of having an AI audience to give you their thoughts and feedback.
		</p>
		<p>
			My thought:
			- It'll look like a social media page a bit, so you post something and then the AI will post comments about it. Can it view the history of the conversation? Maybe.
			- User can create a bunch of personas, maybe have a public library of them to import, and then they can have a conversation with them.
