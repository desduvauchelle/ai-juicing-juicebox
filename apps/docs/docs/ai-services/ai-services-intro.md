# Understanding AI Services 🤖

AI services encompass a wide range of AI models accessible for various applications.

These services are often provided as cloud solutions, such as OpenAI models, Anthropic, and DeepSeek, accessible through APIs.

Alternatively, you can run models locally on your own computer, offering enhanced privacy, control, and potential cost savings. While this is our preferred approach, the optimal choice depends on individual needs.

## Exploring the World of AI Services ✨

Think of AI services as sophisticated tools developed by companies like OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT) and Anthropic. These companies have engineered powerful AI models capable of performing complex tasks. 🧠

## How JUICEBOX AI Integrates with AI Services 🧃

JUICEBOX AI acts as a seamless interface, enabling you to interact with diverse AI services effortlessly. We provide a unified platform for accessing and utilizing various AI models. 📺

## Free AI Services

Certain AI services, such as Ollama, are available for free use. These services offer open access to AI capabilities without incurring any costs. 📚

Ollama operates directly on your computer, eliminating usage fees and subscription requirements. It's like having a personal AI model readily available on your device! 🏠

## Payments and Access Explained 💳

To utilize AI services, you typically need:

1. An account with the specific AI service provider.
2. An API key, serving as a unique access credential.

This is similar to obtaining a library card, which grants you access to borrow books (use the AI).

## Why Use Your Own Account for Cloud Solutions? 🤔

At JUICEBOX AI, we are committed to maintaining a free and open-source platform. By allowing you to interact directly with AI service providers, we ensure transparency and avoid unnecessary fees. This approach offers several advantages:

- Direct control over your accounts. 🎮
- Payment only for the resources you consume. 💰
- A transparent and straightforward process. ✨

In the future, we may introduce a paid service that streamlines access to various models, eliminating the need for multiple accounts. However, for now, we prioritize simplicity and accessibility. 🆓

## Which service to choose?

To be honest, it doesn't matter, they are all very very good and do virtually the same things. Depending on what's more important to you, here are some suggestions:

**Price sensitive:**

- Install and run your own model, see the Ollama section for that
- Google: They have a very generous free tier at the moment

**Privacy:**

- Run Ollama on your computer

**Speed:**

- Pick a cloud provider. They have the best hardware and can run the models the fastest.
- Pick smaller models. They are faster to run.

**Quality:**

- Pick larger models, independent of where they are run.

After that, it's open game. Try them all. See which one you like best.
