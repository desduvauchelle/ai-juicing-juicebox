# What are AI Services? 🤖

What we mean by AI services are any and all AI models available.

These can be cloud solutions, like OpenAI models, Anthropic, DeepSeek, or any other AI model that is available through an API.

You can also run models on your own computer for full privacy, control, cost savings and control! That's our preferred way of doing things, but each their own.

## The Magical World of AI Services ✨

Think of AI services like magical libraries created by companies such as OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT), Anthropic, and others. These companies have built incredible AI "brains" that can help us do amazing things! 🧠

## How JUICEBOX AI Works with These Services 🧃

JUICEBOX AI is like a friendly connector that helps you talk to all these different AI services. We're kind of like a universal remote control that works with many different TVs! 📺

## Free AI Services

Some AI services, like Ollama, are completely free to use. You can think of them as magical libraries that are always open and free to visit! 📚

This is possible because Ollama runs directly on your computer, so there are no usage costs or subscriptions. It's like having a magical book that lives in your house! 🏠

## About Payments and Access 💳

Here's the important part: To use these AI services, you'll need two things:

1. An account with the AI service you want to use
2. A special password (called an "API key") from them

It's kind of like having a library card - you need to get your own card (API key) to check out books (use the AI)!

## Why Do I Need My Own Account for cloud solutions? 🤔

We at JUICEBOX AI want to keep everything free and open source (which means anyone can see and use our code). Instead of us handling payments and charging you extra fees, you can work directly with the AI companies. This way:

- You're in control of your own accounts 🎮
- You pay only for what you use 💰
- Everything stays transparent and simple! ✨

Maybe in the future, we'll create a paid service so that you don't have to create an account everywhere, just use our service and pick whatever model is available. But for now, we're keeping it simple and free! 🆓

## What's Next? ➡️

In the following sections, we'll show you how to get set up with different AI services. Don't worry - we'll guide you through each step! 🌟

Remember: If you can use a library card, you can handle an API key! It's that simple! 😊
