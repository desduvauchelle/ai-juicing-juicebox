# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

We're glad you're here! This is the documentation for the AI Juicing Juicebar project. This project is in early development. It is not ready for production use. It is not ready for general use. It is not ready for any use. It is not ready for anything. It is not ready.

But if you like what you see, you can help us by contributing to the project. You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/desduvauchelle/ai-juicing-juicebox).

## What is AI Juicing Juicebar?

It's a place to experiment and improve. We're totally AI agnostic, and in any case, it changes every other week, but the experiences we create live past that limitation. We're not trying to create the best AI, we're trying to create the best experiences.

## Getting Started

In the near future, you'll be able to access it from anywhere. But for now, you can install the app manually on your computer or try the demo.

[Demo the webapp](https://desduvauchelle.github.io/ai-juicing-juicebox)

The demo is limited for security reasons. You can't save your work, and you can't access the full power of the app. But you can get a taste of what's to come.
