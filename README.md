# AI Juicing - Juicebox

This is an open source project to experiment with AI interfaces to accomplish tasks that you might need. I really hope that the future of AI is open source and private. This project is a step in that direction.

This is an electron apps that will either install and run Ollama on your computer or you can use a remote version of Ollama. It is installed like an application on your computer. You can check the console and network tab in the developer tools to see that is to no interaction with any server other than the AI one. Nothing is stored in the cloud either, all your chats are stored on the app storage (IndexedDB).

To get started, you can either download the app from the releases page or you can clone this repository and run the app locally.
